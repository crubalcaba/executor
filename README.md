# executor

Kemal web server waiting for posts to execute a local command. (extremely overengineered :)

## Installation

Install [crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/install/).

## Usage

`shards install` and you should be good to go :)
(you might need to install `libyaml-dev` or its equivalent in your OS if it fails at building ameba)
